    "text": "Hey there! I‚Äôm Indraneel from India ‚Äî a software engineer and data-driven researcher passionate about building things and solving problems. I‚Äôve worked extensively with R, Python, and Bash, leveraging a wide range of tools and technologies to tackle complex challenges.\nIn R, I specialize in building interactive web applications using {Shiny}, with strong proficiency in the {tidyverse} suite, including {dplyr} for data manipulation and {ggplot2} for data visualization. I‚Äôve developed custom packages like {clintrialx} (clintrialx) and worked with complex datasets such as single-cell sequencing data, utilizing {Seurat} and {Signac}. My expertise extends to implementing reactive programming principles, enabling the creation of user-friendly {Shiny} applications that respond seamlessly to user inputs. Additionally, I have solid experience in package development, testing, and documentation using tools like {testthat}, {pkgdown}, {devtools}, and {roxygen2}.\nIn Python, I‚Äôve worked with popular libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Plotly for data visualization, and Streamlit for building interactive web applications. I‚Äôve also delved into web development using Django and Flask, leveraging my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I‚Äôm comfortable working with cloud services, particularly AWS, and have experience with containerization using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes.\nI enjoy bringing people together and finding creative solutions, whether working on a small-scale project or as part of a larger team. In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or performing technical reviews for yet-to-be-published technical books. I‚Äôm always up for a challenge and finding new ways to improve ‚Äî making a real impact.\nLet‚Äôs connect and see what we can create together! You can reach me at hello.indraneel@gmail.com"
