    "text": "Hi, I’m Indraneel, a tech-first engineer building reliable data and AI/GenAI pipelines, interactive tools, and open-source systems that teams and communities can depend on. I work across R and Python, and I enjoy turning complex problems into usable, maintainable solutions.\nMy background spans Bioinformatics and Pharma, where I’ve worked with complex biological and clinical datasets, including single-cell multiomics and clinical trial registries. This experience taught me how to manage high-stakes data pipelines, ensure reproducibility, and balance rigor with delivery, lessons I carry into all my work."

I am an OSS maintainer and contributor, including maintaining {rentrez} at rOpenSci and Python Lessons at The Carpentries. I’ve also created developer-focused webapps and content with Streamlit and Snowflake, performed technical reviews for Packt technical books, and presented at IASCT ConSPIC 2025 on “Integrating DevSecOps Principles into R for Clinical Data Programming: Enhancing Compliance, Reproducibility, and Efficiency”. These experiences shape how I think about developer experience, reproducible workflows, and sustainable engineering practices."

    "text": "Technical Expertise\nIn R, I build interactive web applications with Shiny, developed and published packages on CRAN such as {clintrialx} and {shiny.ollama}. I focus on user-friendly, maintainable, and reactive applications, using the tidyverse, pharmaverse packages, and LLM integration.\nIn Python, I work with Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit, Django, and Flask, integrating GenAI/LLM capabilities. I also leverage cloud services (AWS), containerization (Docker), and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalable solutions.\nI enjoy bringing people together to deliver high-impact projects - leading teams, building internal tools, and collaborating across disciplines. I focus on standards, clarity, and reliable delivery, while continuously improving processes, sharing knowledge, and contributing to open-source ecosystems.\nIf you’re building scalable, reliable systems, pipelines, or developer-focused tools, let’s connect and collaborate.
