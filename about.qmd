Hey there! I'm Indraneel from India — a software engineer and data-driven researcher passionate about building things and solving problems. I've worked extensively with `R`, `Python`, and `Bash`, leveraging a wide range of tools and technologies to tackle complex challenges.

In `R`, I specialize in building interactive web applications using `{Shiny}`, with strong proficiency in the `{tidyverse}` suite, including `{dplyr}` for data manipulation and `{ggplot2}` for data visualization. I've developed custom packages like `{clintrialx}` ([clintrialx](https://cran.r-project.org/package=clintrialx)) and worked with complex datasets such as single-cell sequencing data, utilizing `{Seurat}` and `{Signac}`. My expertise extends to implementing reactive programming principles, enabling the creation of user-friendly `{Shiny}` applications that respond seamlessly to user inputs. Additionally, I have solid experience in package development, testing, and documentation using tools like `{testthat}`, `{pkgdown}`, `{devtools}`, and `{roxygen2}`.

In `Python`, I've worked with popular libraries like `Pandas` for data manipulation, `Matplotlib` and `Plotly` for data visualization, and `Streamlit` for building interactive web applications. I've also delved into web development using `Django` and `Flask`, leveraging my knowledge of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. I'm comfortable working with cloud services, particularly `AWS`, and have experience with containerization using `Docker` and orchestration with `Kubernetes`.

I enjoy bringing people together and finding creative solutions, whether working on a small-scale project or as part of a larger team. In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or performing technical reviews for yet-to-be-published technical books. I'm always up for a challenge and finding new ways to improve — making a real impact.

Let's connect and see what we can create together! You can reach me at hello.indraneel@gmail.com
