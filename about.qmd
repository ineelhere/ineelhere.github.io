Hi, I'm Indraneel, a tech-first engineer building reliable data and AI/GenAI pipelines, interactive tools, and open-source systems that teams and communities can depend on. I work across `R` and `Python`, and I enjoy turning complex problems into usable, maintainable solutions.

My background spans Bioinformatics and Pharma, where I've worked with complex biological and clinical datasets, including single-cell multiomics and clinical trial registries. This experience taught me how to manage high-stakes data pipelines, ensure reproducibility, and balance rigor with delivery, lessons I carry into all my work.

## Open-Source & Community

Open-source and volunteering are central to my work. I am an OSS maintainer and contributor, including maintaining `{rentrez}` at [rOpenSci](https://docs.ropensci.org/rentrez/) and [Python Lessons](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation) at The Carpentries. I've also created developer-focused webapps and content with Streamlit and Snowflake, performed technical reviews for Packt technical books, and presented at IASCT ConSPIC 2025 on "Integrating DevSecOps Principles into R for Clinical Data Programming: Enhancing Compliance, Reproducibility, and Efficiency". These experiences shape how I think about developer experience, reproducible workflows, and sustainable engineering practices.

## Technical Expertise

In `R`, I build interactive web applications with `Shiny`, developed and published packages on CRAN such as `{clintrialx}` and `{shiny.ollama}`. I focus on user-friendly, maintainable, and reactive applications, using the tidyverse, pharmaverse packages, and LLM integration.

In `Python`, I work with Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit, Django, and Flask, integrating GenAI/LLM capabilities. I also leverage cloud services (`AWS`), containerization (`Docker`), and orchestration (`Kubernetes`) for scalable solutions.

I enjoy bringing people together to deliver high-impact projects - leading teams, building internal tools, and collaborating across disciplines. I focus on standards, clarity, and reliable delivery, while continuously improving processes, sharing knowledge, and contributing to open-source ecosystems.

If you're building scalable, reliable systems, pipelines, or developer-focused tools, let's connect and collaborate. Feel free to reach me at hello.indraneel@gmail.com!
